\section{Introduction}
Since the first one was developed, refrigerator has been an essential device that cannot be separated from human life. Nowadays, refrigerators became so important that foods without refrigerator stored is totally rarely, but a critical weakness exists: narrow space.
We could be inexperienced to arrange contents inside the refrigerator, also classify some foods that influence others, even we may forget the existence of food or miss the position.
There are certain mobile applications helping people managing their refrigerators on the market, but their functions seem to be limited to only managing expiration date of the foods inside the refrigerator. 
‘Freshkeeper’ is an app that advise how to rearrange the substances with LG refrigerators. It might be helpful for users who admire to keep foods safe and fresh or feel hard to manage refrigerator space. Freshkeeper will identify the model of refrigerator and recognize items occupying refrigerator space to offer customers recommendations how to sort items effectively or visually by the user side.



\subsection{Significance of Refrigerators in Modern Life}
    
To appreciate the value of Freshkeeper, it's important to recognize the pivotal role refrigerators play in modern life. Refrigerators have become a staple in households around the world. They have transformed the way we store and consume food, ensuring that fresh and perishable items remain safe for consumption. Refrigerators have become an integral part of our daily lives, allowing us to keep a wide range of foods and beverages readily accessible. As a result, it's rare to find a household without a refrigerator.

However, this technological marvel comes with its own set of challenges. The most prominent among these challenges is the issue of limited space. Despite the generous storage capacity of modern refrigerators, users often find it difficult to efficiently organize their food items. This can lead to several problems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Inefficient Arrangement\par
    Users might be inexperienced in arranging the contents of their refrigerators. They may struggle to categorize different foods or may inadvertently store items in a way that influences others negatively. The consequence is a cluttered and poorly organized fridge.    
    \item Food Wastage\par
    Inefficient organization often results in users forgetting about the existence of certain food items. These items may get pushed to the back of the refrigerator, where they are eventually forgotten and go to waste. This not only leads to financial losses but also contributes to food wastage, a pressing global issue.    
    \item Difficulty in Finding Items\par
    A chaotic refrigerator can be frustrating to deal with. When you're unable to locate specific items, it not only wastes time but can also lead to unnecessary stress and annoyance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Motivation}

The advent of smart home technology has brought about a paradigm shift in the way we interact with our everyday appliances. Refrigerators, once considered a humble and indispensable part of our lives, have now been reimagined as sophisticated devices in the era of LG's smarthome services. As part of this transformative journey, the development of the Freshkeeper application emerges as a remarkable innovation, one that promises to enhance the way we manage the contents of our refrigerators.

Freshkeeper is envisioned as an ingenious solution that delves into the intricate world of refrigerator management. It goes beyond the conventional purpose of a refrigerator as a mere storage space and adds a layer of intelligence to it. This application analyzes the structure of the customer's refrigerator model and calculates the optimized composition of substances within, while also providing valuable notifications about expiration dates. In doing so, it aims to revolutionize the way we consume food, fostering efficiency, health, and convenience.

\subsection{Objectives}
The objectives of Freshkeeper can be summarized in two simple yet profound words: 'optimization' and 'convenience.' Let's delve into how these objectives are achieved and the benefits they bring to users.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimization\par
    Freshkeeper seeks to optimize the way we use our refrigerator space. Modern refrigerators are a marvel of engineering, offering ample storage capacity, yet their potential often goes underutilized. Many users struggle with inefficiently organized contents, which not only waste space but also make it difficult to locate items when needed. Refrrange comes to the rescue by providing recommendations on how to rearrange the contents of the refrigerator to create more empty spaces, allowing users to store more items effectively. This optimization ensures that users get the most out of their refrigerator's capacity and minimizes food wastage.
    \item Convenience\par
    A cluttered refrigerator can be frustrating and chaotic to deal with. An inconvenient user interface and vague advice on food placement can exacerbate the problem. Freshkeeper takes convenience seriously by offering a user-friendly interface and clear, practical recommendations. Users are guided through the process of arranging their refrigerator, making it a hassle-free and enjoyable experience. The application aims to prevent uncomfortable instances by providing precise, easy-to-follow suggestions. The result is a refrigerator that is not only space-efficient but also a pleasure to use.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problem Statement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Food Labeling and Categorization\par
    Our application should accurately categorize and label various food items to provide relevant recommendations. 
    \item Data Privacy and Security\par
    Because of the data analysis, user data collection is essential on working app normally. Security and privacy of user data should be ensured when the app deals with information such as user food inventory or consumption preference.
    \item Accuracy of Expiration Dates\par
    Expiration Dates are directly related to user health. Not to offer wrong expiration date is the most important problem Freshkeeper deals with.
    \item Notification and Reminder\par
    Timely delivery notifications and reminders is considerable in user-friendly aspect. Inform upcoming expiration dates have to be available for users.
    \item Inventory Tracking and Update\par
    Similar to expiration dates problem, tracking of refrigerator storage is in consideration how much value is on either the importance and the accuracy of inventory.
    \item User Interface and User Experience\par
    User-friendly interface and clear visualization of advice is another problem we got.

\section{Development Environment}
\subsection{Choice of software development platform}
Our team develops applications for both Mac and Windows operating system environments. We have selected relevant frameworks for cross-platform development. First of all, cross-platform mobile app development refers to the method of developing software on multiple different platforms or operating systems using the same code base. In the early days of cross-platform, people were reluctant to use it because the performance did not keep up with native apps, but recent technologies are approaching the level of native apps and are on their way to being recommended.  Some examples include React Native, Flutter, Xamarin, and NativeScript. These frameworks are used to develop applications that run on multiple platforms using one code base.  For this, the latest versions of Windows and MacOS are needed.  \par
Windows 11  - Windows 11 is the most recent version, offering a new look and feel to the user interface, performance improvements, and features Microsoft Teams integration and support for Android apps. \par
MacOS 12 (Monterey)  - MacOS 12 offers unified control across Apple devices with Universal Control and enables mirroring of iOS and iPadOS screens to a Mac via AirPlay to Mac. It enhances the user experience by including Focus mode, the Shortcuts app, an improved Safari browser, increased privacy, and teamwork features.

For this project, we created a team workspace to collaborate. The UI/UX design of the application will be done utilizing Figma. For the overall project schedule, execution, process, and meeting log management, we utilized Notion and shared it with team members. To communicate, we used Slack, the collaboration tool. In addition to acting as a messenger, Slack was great for uploading and sharing files.

Tools and Language & Reason  \\
\hline
Flutter
& First announced by Google in 2017, Flutter was originally created to run on the Fuchsia operating system, but it became a cross-platform platform when Google decided to make it compatible with other operating systems.
Because it was created by Google, it has excellent performance running on Android first, and it is truly cross-platform as it runs on iOS, Android, Windows app development for macOS, and even web browsers recently, and it is the fastest growing cross-platform.
Since Flutter can target iOS, Android, web, and desktop platforms with one codebase, we felt it would simplify development and maintenance, saving us time and money. Another key feature is that Flutter is composed of reusable UI components called widgets, which are used to build every part of the application. These widgets are rich, extensible, and help us build UIs quickly, so we felt it made sense to develop with agile methods to ensure the success of our project.\\

\hline
Node.js 
& A JavaScript-based software platform that can be used to develop server-side applications.
It runs on a variety of platforms including MS Windows, Linux, and macOS. Created with the vision of "JavaScript everywhere," the advent of Node.js made it possible to develop both web client and server applications using only the JavaScript language.
Our team felt that Node.js was an ideal choice for connecting our front-end and back-end and providing APIs, as we felt that a single language and technology stack could manage the entire stack, which would be very useful in integrating with the front-end.Node.js also has the advantage of having an active developer community and a diverse open source package ecosystem, with tons of libraries and modules readily available through its package manager, npm.

\section{Specifications}
Freshkeeper provides users with a variety of features to make early morning delivery convenient and fresh while using their LG refrigerators. The Freshkeeper is a mini fridge that can be placed near the front door for early morning delivery users. As the number of consumers using early morning delivery has exploded, the amount of waste generated has become a social problem. Therefore, we want to present a mini portable refrigerator that provides refrigeration by using our service, and appeal to the fact that it can be stored anywhere at the moment when refrigeration is needed. 
When users stored in the database access the application, they are provided with the following key features. \\
(The app screen hasn't been configured yet, so we couldn't attach it. Therefore, Our team put the overall structure in the form of a graphical diagram. And we will explain the main functions and update it with images as soon as the screen configuration is completed. )
\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\includegraphics[width=9cm,height=9cm]{다이어그램.jpg}}
\caption{Overall Process}
\label{fig}
\end{figure}

\subsection{login and sign-up}
This page requires users to sign up to create an account and then sign in to use this service. The login page is used for user authentication. Because the application handles the user's shipping order information, estimated time of arrival, etc.
user's information, all user's information associated with the shipping service must be stored based on a unique email user account.

\subsection{Main Page}
The main page will provide a dashboard of frequently requested items at a glance, and we'll also be adding a quick launch feature for the NUGU AI speaker.

\subsection{Healthy Dishes Generator}
Utilizing ChatGPT, a generative AI, we plan to add an option to load the user's order history and select healthy ingredients that can be substituted with healthy ingredients to create a "Healthy Dishes Generator" feature. \par
 ex ) If you ordered sugar → How about using stevia instead next time? Or Butter → vegetable oil 
This is a feature that allows user to 'input' purchases list and either 1) create a healthy meal recipe or 2) learn from user's past orders and create healthier alternatives. 
\subsection{Mini Fridge (Freshkeeper) to Main Fridge (LG model) Integration}
We can utilize mobile APIs and sensors to check what's inside the mini fridge.Real time check: Check the items inside using the weight sensor.
Notification: If the weight sensor is 'true' for a certain period of time send a notification (like checking the mailbox)
Sleep mode: Customize the mini fridge to run when no deliveries are scheduled, etc.
Wake-up notification: When the user wakes up in the morning and opens the main fridge, know that the user is awake and notify the mini fridge that an item has been delivered (send a push message) or through the speaker.

\subsection{Coupang OPEN API Integration}
To connect to Coupang OPEN API, we will develop according to the guide, such as searching for products and checking product registration status on the Coupang Developers site. This feature allows that user can see the status of an item, whether it's being prepared, refunded, or placed on order. We're also working on a technology that, when applied to 'sleep mode', will check the estimated arrival time and turn on the refrigerator in time to avoid disturbing you in the wee hours of the morning. If the product is delivered but the weight sensor is false, we are also thinking about checking the image to prevent non-delivery errors. 
\subsection{Utilizing NUGU AI Speaker}
Utilizing the NUGU SDK provided by SK Telecom's NUGU developers, we will create AI services by connecting the NUGU platform to internet-connected devices and our applications. 
In our FreshKeeper mobile app, users can check the estimated arrival time based on voice recognition, receive an alert if the door is not closed, and remotely open the door of the mini fridge. 
\subsection{My Page / Settings}
On this page, user can set privacy settings or link LG Refrigerator device here.
